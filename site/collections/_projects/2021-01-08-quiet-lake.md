The "Shanbalik" project is a major initiative aimed at reviving the ancient Uzbek tradition of communal cleaning activities, known as hashar, which take place on Saturdays. This project aims to engage the local community in environmental conservation efforts, fostering a sense of collective responsibility and pride in maintaining a clean and healthy environment. By organizing regular cleaning events, "Shanbalik" seeks not only to ensure the immediate cleanliness of public spaces but also to teach and inspire community members to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives.
